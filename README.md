How This App Was Built
----------------------

The development of this application followed a structured process to ensure quality and alignment with project requirements. Below is an overview of the key steps taken during the app's creation:

1.  **Initial Planning**:

    -   The development team conducted meetings to define project requirements and create detailed user stories.
    -   Once finalized, these requirements and user stories were documented to guide the development process.
2.  **Database Creation**:

    -   The team's database developer created the project's database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
3.  **UI/Frontend Design**:

    -   The UI/Frontend developers worked on the application's interface designs, ensuring they met the requirements and user stories.
    -   These designs were reviewed and finalized in a team meeting before being handed over to the backend development team.
4.  **Prototype Development**:

    -   The backend development team built an initial all-in-one prototype, implementing most of the app's core functionality.
    -   This prototype was shared among team members via a .zip file in the team's work chat to ensure everyone had access to the code.
5.  **Feedback and Iteration**:

    -   Feedback was collected from the client and other stakeholders during several review sessions.
    -   The team held meetings to discuss and implement changes based on this feedback.
6.  **Splitting Functionality**:

    -   Once all the required functionality was implemented, the team separated the application into two components:
        -   **API Application**: To handle backend logic and database interactions.
        -   **Client Application**: To provide the user interface and client-side functionality.
    -   Both components were pushed to their respective GitHub repositories.
7.  **Development Workflow**:

    -   To ensure code consistency, the team adopted a local development workflow:
        -   Frontend and backend developers worked on the apps locally.
        -   Updates and new builds were shared in the team's work chat for review.
    -   The lead backend developer/tester tested all updates locally, verifying new features and fixes before committing changes to GitHub.
8.  **Streamlined Testing and Updates**:

    -   The tester provided detailed feedback on new features and updates, allowing team members to address issues locally.
    -   This streamlined pipeline ensured that only tested and approved changes were committed to the repositories, maintaining the quality of both the API and client apps.

For team member roles and responsibilities, please refer to the **Project Authors** section above.

Getting Started (Client App)
----------------------------
# This app requires an API, you can download configure the API separately, by accessing the API setup guide in this repository: [BumbleBee Foundation API app]()

Follow these steps to set up and run the client application locally:

### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, clone or download the code from the **client repository**.

#### Using Git:

Open your terminal or Git Bash and run the following command:

```
git clone 
```

#### Download as ZIP:

Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file directly from GitHub. Click the "Code" button on the repository page, then select "Download ZIP." Once downloaded, extract the contents to a folder of your choice.

### 2\. Open the Client App in Visual Studio

-   Open **Visual Studio 2022**.
-   Select **Open a Project or Solution** from the start window.
-   Navigate to the folder where you cloned or extracted the client repository.
-   Select the solution file (`.sln`) and click **Open**.

### 3\. Configure the API URL in the Client App

To connect the client app to the API, you need to update the API URL in the `Program.cs` file:

-   In **Visual Studio**, go to the `Program.cs` file in the client app.
-   Find the following code:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("ApiHttpClient", client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:0000/");
    // Add any default headers
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "application/json");
});

```

-   Run the API app and locate the local host URL in your browser. Copy the URL in your browser and replace the URL (`https://localhost:5672/`) in the `Program.cs` file of the client app, with the URL of your running API. Ensure this matches the actual URL for your API.

> **Important:** The client app needs the exact URL for the API to connect properly. If the URL is incorrect or missing, the client won't be able to interact with the API.

### 4\. Set Up the Currency API Key  

To support donations from users in different countries, the app includes a **Currency Conversion Service**.  

### Setting Up the Currency Conversion Service  

1. **Obtain an API Key**  
   - Create a free account and obtain a free or trial API key from [CurrencyAPI](https://currencyapi.com/).  
  
To enable the currency converter feature, you must set up an environment variable on you machine for the **currency API key**:

#### Create the Environment Variable:

-   Follow this guide: [How to create Environment Variables on Windows](https://pureinfotech.com/create-custom-environment-variables-windows-10/) to set up the environment variable on your PC.
-   Set the **variable name** to `CURRENCY_API_KEY`.
-   Set the **variable value** to the API key you received from [CurrencyAPI](https://currencyapi.com/).

#### Save and Restart:

-   After saving the environment variable, restart your PC to ensure it's properly applied.  

### Payment Gateway  

This prototype integrates a sandbox version of the **PayFast** gateway for testing purposes.  

### Setting Up the PayFast Gateway  

1. **Create a Sandbox Account**  
   - Register for a sandbox account at [PayFast Sandbox](https://sandbox.payfast.co.za/).  

2. **Obtain Sandbox Credentials**  
   - Once your sandbox account is set up, obtain the following credentials:  
     - **MerchantId**  
     - **MerchantKey**  
     - **PassPhrase**  

3. **Update the Configuration File**  
   - Open the `appsettings.json` file in the project.  
   - Update the `PayFast` configuration section with your sandbox credentials:  
     ```json  
     "PayFast": {  
       "MerchantId": "<Your-MerchantId>",  
       "MerchantKey": "<Your-MerchantKey>",  
       "PassPhrase": "<Your-PassPhrase>",  
       "ProcessUrl": "https://sandbox.payfast.co.za/eng/process",  
       "UseSandbox": true  
     }  
     ```  

 
With your credentials in place, the app will utilize the PayFast sandbox environment for testing.  

### Notes  
- The **UseSandbox** property is set to `true` to ensure transactions are processed in the sandbox environment and not in production.  
- For additional setup guidance, refer to the [PayFast Documentation](https://developers.payfast.co.za/docs).

### Run the Client App

Once everything is configured, you can run the client application:

-   Make sure the **API app** is already running. If not, you can refer to the API's README for setup instructions.
-   In **Visual Studio**, press **F5** to build and run the client application.

Both the client and API need to be running at the same time for the application to function properly. If the API isn't running, the client will be unable to connect, and you won't be able to log in or use the app features.

### Summary

1.  Clone or download the client app repository.
2.  Open the client app in Visual Studio.
3.  Update the API URL in the `Program.cs` file to match your local API.
4.  Set up the `CURRENCY_API_KEY` environment variable for currency conversion features.
5.  Run the client app in Visual Studio while the API is running.

Once both the client and API are running, you should be able to log in and interact with the app!

# **Email Features Disclaimer**

Emails and Notifications
------------------------

This application uses **AWS Simple Email Service (SES)** to handle email notifications. Below is an overview of the email features and configuration details:

### **Email Features**

1.  **Donation Notifications**:

    -   When a user makes a donation, the app sends a notification email to the organization's email address to inform the admin about the donation.
2.  **Password Reset Alerts**:

    -   When a user attempts to reset their password, the app sends an alert email to the user's email address to notify them of the request.
3.  **Document Upload Notifications**:

    -   When a user uploads documents (e.g., as part of a funding request), the app sends a notification email to the organization's email address to alert the admin.
4.  **Donation Approval Emails**:

    -   When an admin approves a donation, the app sends the user a confirmation email that includes the Section 18 certificate.
5.  **Profile Deactivation Emails**:

    -   If an admin deactivates a user's profile, the app sends an email to the user notifying them of the deactivation.

* * * * *

### **AWS SES Sandbox Environment**

This prototype is currently configured to use the **AWS SES Sandbox** environment. This means that emails are only sent to manually added and verified email addresses. For broader functionality and testing, you will need to configure your own AWS SES setup.

# Follow this guide to set up AWS SES:
[Getting Started with AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/getting-started/)

* * * * *

### **Customizing Email Settings**

To use your own AWS SES configuration, update the `appsettings.json` file in the client application with your credentials:

```csharp
"SmtpSettings": {
   "Host": "(Your host credentials)",
   "Port": (Port number for your host),
   "UserName": "(Your AWS SES username)",
   "Password": "(Your AWS SES password)",
   "FromEmail": "(The main email address AWS SES will use to send emails)",
   "FromName": "BumbleBee App",
   "AdminEmail": "(The email address for admin notifications)"
}

```

#### **Field Descriptions:**

-   **Host**: Your SMTP host credentials provided by AWS SES.
-   **Port**: The port number for AWS SES (typically 587 or 465 for secure connections).
-   **UserName**: Your AWS SES username.
-   **Password**: Your AWS SES password.
-   **FromEmail**: The main email address that AWS SES will use to send emails to users.
-   **FromName**: The display name for outgoing emails (e.g., "BumbleBee App").
-   **AdminEmail**: The email address where admin notifications (e.g., donation or document upload alerts) will be sent.

* * * * *

### **Important Notes for Testing**

-   Verify your email addresses in the AWS SES Sandbox to ensure they can receive emails.
-   Transition out of the sandbox environment to enable sending emails to unverified addresses in production.

## **The app will still function without the email service set up, however any email addresses you provide the app will not receive notifications**

Creating an Admin User
----------------------

As the BumbleBee Foundation App prototype prepares for a production release, the development team has opted to remove the ability to register as an admin directly within the client app. This decision was made to mitigate potential security risks in a production environment. Instead, there are two methods for creating an admin account:

### 1\. **Using the Standalone Companion Console App**

For secure admin account creation, you can use our **standalone companion console app**, which you can download here: [Companion App](https://github.com/SamTheCopy-ninja/BumbleBeeAdminCreator.git).

-   This app generates an SQL command that a database administrator can run to manually add an admin user to the backend database.
-   Once the admin account is added, you can log in to the client app using the provided email and plaintext password.
-   For more details about the console app, refer to its documentation.

This approach minimizes security risks by avoiding direct admin creation through the client app.

* * * * *

### 2\. **Restoring the Admin Option in the Client App**

If you prefer a faster testing setup or wish to bypass the standalone app, you can re-enable the admin registration option in the client app by modifying the code:

1.  Open the client app and navigate to the `Register.cshtml` file located at: **`Views\Account\Register.cshtml`** in the Solution Explorer

2.  Locate the following section of the code:

    ```html
    <div class="form-group">
        <label asp-for="Role" class="control-label"></label>
        <select asp-for="Role" class="form-control" id="roleSelect">
            <option value="">Select a role</option>
            <option value="Company">Company</option>
            <option value="Donor">Donor</option>
            @* <option value="Admin">Admin</option> *@
        </select>
        <span asp-validation-for="Role" class="text-danger"></span>
    </div>

    ```

3.  Uncomment the following line to re-enable the admin option:

    ```
    @* <option value="Admin">Admin</option> *@

    ```

    After modification, it should look like this:

    ```
    <option value="Admin">Admin</option>

    ```

4.  Save the changes, run the client app, and navigate to the registration page. You can now select "Admin" as the role and create an admin account by entering the required information.

* * * * *

### Recommendation

For production environments, **method 1 (companion app)** is strongly recommended to maintain security best practices. Method 2 is only suggested for testing and development purposes, as enabling direct admin registration in the client app could expose vulnerabilities in a live system.
